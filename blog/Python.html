        Learn python
        If you want to know how to learn Python, this is the only guide you’ll ever need.

        A little over a decade ago, I was a college graduate with a history degree and few prospects. Then, I became a
        successful machine learning engineer, data science consultant, and now CEO of Dataquest.

        This is not an overnight success story, though. My journey to learn Python was long, inefficient, and frequently
        discouraging.

        If I could do it over again, I would follow the steps I’m going to share with you in this article. It would have
        fast-tracked my career, saved thousands of hours of wasted time, and prevented a lot of stress.

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">What’s in This Guide</h2>
        To be successful with Python, you need to know how to think, study, plan, and execute effectively. This guide
        addresses all of that.

        We’ll discuss pitfalls to avoid and identify sources of motivation. We’ll also address the best ways to learn
        basic syntax and how to get started with real Python projects.

        Want to skip ahead and begin learning Python the right way? Try our interactive courses. They can take you from
        complete beginner to job-ready, using actual code in mere months.

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">The Dreaded Learning Curve (Why Most Fail)</h2>
        Learning Python can be a difficult and painful experience. But it doesn’t have to be! Take it from me.

        If you’re using the right resources, learning Python can be easy.

        The problem is that many of the courses out there make learning Python more difficult than it has to be. To
        illustrate my point, I’ll give you a personal example.

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Too Many Courses Overplay Syntax</h2>
        When I first started learning Python, I wanted to do the things that excited me, like making websites.
        Unfortunately, the course I was taking forced me to spend multiple months on syntax.

        Python code continued to look foreign and confusing, like this:

        from django.http import HttpResponse
        def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
        To beginners, this code might as well be an alien language. It’s no surprise I quickly lost interest.

        Regrettably, most Python tutorials are very similar to this. They assume you need to learn all of Python syntax
        before you can start doing anything interesting. Is it any wonder most people give up?

        Instead of wasting time on these mundane tasks, you could be experiencing the real thrills of Python. Think
        analyzing data, building a website, or creating an autonomous drone with artificial intelligence!

        learning python should not feel like this
        Learning Python syntax doesn’t have to feel like this.
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Don’t Worry — There’s an Easier Way</h2>
        After many failed attempts, I found a process that worked better for me. In fact, I believe this is the best way
        for anyone to learn Python programming.

        First, I spent as little time as possible memorizing Python syntax. Then, I took what I learned and immediately
        dove headfirst into a project I actually found interesting.

        Following the process outlined below is not only more fun, but it allows you to learn at an incredible rate!

        In fact, this better way of learning is how every Dataquest course is structured. Check out some of our Python
        courses here.

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Step 1: Identify What Motivates You</h2>
        Here’s the good news: Anyone can reach a high level of proficiency in Python with the right motivation.

        As a beginner, I struggled to keep myself awake when trying to memorize syntax. However, when I needed to apply
        Python fundamentals to build an interesting project, I happily stayed up all night to finish it.

        What’s the lesson here? You need to find what motivates you and get excited about it! To get started, find one
        or two areas that interest you:

        Data Science / Machine learning
        Mobile Apps
        Websites
        Computer Science
        Games
        Data Processing and Analysis
        Hardware / Sensors / Robots
        Automating Work Tasks

        Yes, you can make robots using the Python programming language! From the Raspberry Pi Cookbook.
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Step 2: Learn the Basic Syntax, Quickly</h2>
        I know, I know. I said we’d spend as little time as possible on syntax. Unfortunately, this step can’t be
        skipped entirely.

        Here are some good resources to help you learn the Python basics without killing your motivation:

        Dataquest – Python for Data Science Fundamentals Course — I started Dataquest to make learning Python and data
        science easier. Dataquest teaches Python syntax in the context of learning data science. For example, you’ll
        learn basic Python commands while analyzing weather data.
        Learn Python the Hard Way — A book that teaches Python concepts from the basics to more in-depth programs.
        The Python Tutorial — The tutorial on the main Python site.
        I can’t emphasize this enough: Learn what syntax you can and move on. Ideally, you will spend a couple of weeks
        on this phase, but no more than a month.

        The sooner you can get to work on projects, the faster you will learn. You can always refer back to the syntax
        later, if necessary.

        Quick note: Learn Python 3, not Python 2. Unfortunately, a lot of “learn Python” resources online still teach
        Python 2. But Python 2 is no longer supported, so bugs and security holes will not be fixed!

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Step 3: Make Structured Projects</h2>
        Once you’ve learned the basic Python syntax, start doing projects. Applying your knowledge right away will help
        you remember everything you’ve learned.

        It’s better to begin with structured projects until you feel comfortable enough to make projects on your own.
        Here at Dataquest, we’ve strategically included structured projects in virtually all of our Python courses. That
        way, you can immediately apply what you’ve learned.

        Here are some examples of actual Dataquest projects. Which one ignites your curiosity?

        using real data from the movie.
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15"> Inspiration for Structured Projects</h2>
        When it comes to structured projects, there is no one right place to start. The best resources for you will
        depend on what motivates you as well as what your goals are for Python programming.

        Are you interested in general data science or machine learning? Do you want to build something specific like an
        app or website? Here are some recommended resources for inspiration, organized by category:

        working on your own projects.

        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Step 4: Work on Python Projects on Your Own</h2>
        After you’ve worked through a few structured projects, it’s time to ramp things up. You can speed up your
        learning by working on independent Python projects.

        Here’s the key: Start with a small project. It’s better to finish a small project rather than embark on a huge
        project that never gets completed.
