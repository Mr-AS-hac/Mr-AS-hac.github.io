           <h1> How To Learn Java In 10 Easy Steps</h1>
            One must be wondering what the best way to learn java programming is. There are steps, which are lined to help
            you to code java. One must be all aware that the first step towards learning something new is to know how to
            begin the work. It can surely be a difficult and time-consuming task but the most important deciding factor is
            to continue the pursuit.
    
            Java is one of the best programming languages. It is actually an application layer programming language and is
            not very difficult to learn. It does require any prior programming experience to properly learn java coding.
            Well if you are aware of the programming language, then learning Java can be easy.
    
            <h2 class="q1">Step 1: Decide your Mind – Ignore Critics</h2>
            Not each and everybody is fond of programming language hence they will surely deter you from learning the
            language. The world of programming is loaded with different competing languages and so it is certainly not
            possible to choose the best one. A language which works perfectly for you may not serve the same purpose for
            someone else.
    
            So instead of paying attention to the critics, focus on the language you are learning.
    
            <h2 class="q1">Step 2: Install Eclipse IDE and Java</h2>
            It is very much possible to learn Java by installing Java SDK but the learning curve is real slow in this case.
            When Java SDK is effectively combined with an IDE, it provides an integrated development environment taking care
            of all the needs helping you to learn quickly and effectively. Eclipse is the best can be downloaded free.
    
            <h2 class="q1">Step 3: Learn Java Fundamentals</h2>
            The most logical way in which one can start learning Java is to start with the fundamental concept. In order to
            learn the basics of the programming language, you can certainly make use of free tutorial or download them good
            e-book.
    
            Some of the key concepts one must learn are:
    
            Concepts of object-oriented programming concepts, which includes encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and
            polymorphism.
            Why is Java independent of a platform? How can it be easily run on various operating systems like Unix, Windows
            or Mac?
            How do Java Virtual Machine works?
            Knowing about Java Collection framework
            Good understanding of various data types with few java language classes like System, String-Math and much more.
            Try competition of coding to evaluate programming skills.
            <h2 class="q1">Step 4: Read Some Good Books from Experts</h2>
            Online e-books along with tutorials will help you to learn Java in an effective manner seeing at the language
            point of view right from an expert professional. Start Reading books written by Java professionals and
            programmers giving a proper insight in the process of coding.
    
           <h2 class="q1"> Step 5: Start Creating Simple Application With The Use Of Your Knowledge</h2>
            Getting to know only the theoretical concepts of Java will surely not make you a programming expert. Right for
            this, you will be required to put theory into practice. Get to use knowledge acquired by you and start to create
            a simple application. You can go for simple coding to keep your motivation levels high.
    
            Try some logic exercises like:
    
            Deciding a factorial of a number
            Creating a Fibonacci series
            Finding all prime numbers between 1 to 1000
            Print number in word
            Try file input/output:
    
            Read a file and display its content right on the console
            List all the files in the directory
            Creating a file with proper content
            Read input right from user on console
            <h2 class="q1">Step 6: Take The Higher Level As Simple Is Not Enough</h2>
            Once you are done with basic Java coding exercises and has attained the comfort level in using the language, you
            can take the next level and create programs and application requiring complex and advanced levels of
            programming.
    
            Building a number pyramid on any size based on the input size
            Creating a small text based 2 player game
            <h2 class="q1">Step 7: Learn Servlets and JSP</h2>
            A web application is a dynamic extension of the application server or the web. The introduction of Java EE 6 has
            resulted in an improvement over various previous versions with terms of adding good standard APIs like Servlets
            and JSP.
    
            Learning the additional APIs will help you with new things and integrate Java programming with additional
            frameworks and tools.
    
            Build an application to capture user details in the form and save the detail in MySQL with the database using
            JDBC.
            Building a Tic Tac Toe game which two players can play.
            Adding authentication to the game allowing users with username/password.
            <h2 class="q1">Step 8: Learning JSF</h2>
            JSF or JavaServer Faces is a web framework helping in the simplification of user interfaces with Java web
            applications. It can be done with reusable components within a page. There are many popular functions like
            accessing and manipulating components with tag libraries and automatic saving of data with re-population getting
            displayed on the client’s side.
    
            Building a simple shopping cart application
            Building simple web based chatting application
            <h2 class="q1">Step 9: Build An Awesome Web Application</h2>
            These may be of two different types namely service oriented or presentation oriented. Depending on what one
            want, one can create an awesome web application with use of web components which is learned so far.
    
            <h2 class="q1">Step 10: Continue Learning Or Keeping Up With The Latest Trends</h2>
            If you are a programmer, you cannot get away with learning as you do need to learn the professional skills in
            the world of programming. For a java programmer, it is very important to know the latest trends competing over
            others. Blogs from expert programmer can surely be learned for fun making you stand out as an effective
            programmer.
