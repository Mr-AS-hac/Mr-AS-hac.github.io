        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Why learn JavaScript Programming Language?</h2>
        JavaScript is the most popular client-side programming language which is widely used for web application development
        in every industry. There is a huge demand in the IT industry for candidates having knowledge of JavaScript.
        Therefore, learning JavaScript is beneficial for you to get a good job and also enhance your skills and knowledge as
        well.
    
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15"> How do JavaScript engines work?</h2>
        JavaScript Engines are complicated. But it works on some simple basics:
    
        The engine reads (“parses:) the script.
        Then it converts or compiles the script to the machine language.
        After that machine code runs.
        Here, JavaScript engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It reads a compiled script and analyzes
        the data that passes in JavaScript engine. After that, it applies optimizations to the machine code from that
        acquired knowledge. When this process is completed, scripts run quite fast.
    
    
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15"> What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h2>
        JavaScript’s functionality depends on the environment it’s running in. For example, Node.js supports functions which
        allows JavaScript to read and write arbitrary files, perform network requests, object-oriented, etc. The roles that
        JavaScript plays in both client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) development of applications can vary
        wildly.
    
        In-browser JavaScript also allows you to perform webpage manipulation, interaction with the user and with the web
        server.
    
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">Javascript offer advantages like:</h2>
        Show dynamic content based on the user profile.
        React to user’s operations, like mouse clicks events, key presses or pointer movements.
        Support features like auto-validated form entries and interactive drop-down menus.
        Send requests to remote servers, Upload and download files.
        JavaScript code can also create movement and sound
        Ask questions to the users, Get and set cookies, show messages, switch browser tabs.
        Allows the data to be stored in the local storage.
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15">What can’t in-browser JavaScript do?</h2>
        JavaScript’s capabilities in the browser are quite limited for the sake of the user’s safety. It helps to prevent
        any unauthorized webpage from accessing private information.
    
        Examples of such limitations are:
    
        JavaScript on a webpage may not allow you to copy, execute or read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk. It
        doesn’t offer any access to Operating system functions.
        Many browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is very limited and only provided if the user is
        performing a specific action like, dropping a file into a browser window or selecting using < input > tag.
        JavaScript allows you to communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. Although, it does
        not allow you to receive data from other sites/domains.
        What makes JavaScript unique?
        Here, are the three most important features which make JavaScript unique
    
        It offers full integration with HTML/CSS.
        Simple things are done quickly without any complication or following strict rules.
        Supported by all major browsers and JavaScript is enabled by default.
        Alternatives to JavaScript
        The syntax of JavaScript not suited for everyone as different project demands different features. However, some
        modern tools like a Coffee script, Typescript, and Dart allowing developers to code in another language and then
        auto-convert into the JavaScript code.
    
        <h2 class="q1 padd-15"> Where is JavaScript Today?</h2>
        ECMAScript is a specification governed by ECMA international aimed at standardizing JavaScript. The latest version
        is ECMA9 also called JavaScript 9. It is supported by all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer,
        etc. Though each browser has an array of unique commands that are not part of the standards.
